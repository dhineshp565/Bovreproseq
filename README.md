# Bovreproseq
Targeted multiplex amplicon Sequencing for Bovine Reproductive Pathogens
Pipeline should work for any multiplex amplicon sequencing. Outputs consensus sequences and Igv html report if there are any reads mapped to reference. Requires input csv file(sample name,samplepath),refrence sequence (fasta),primerbedfile (chrom name-should match header in reference sequence,primer start and end coordinates (5'-3')
